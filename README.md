# dux

The name `dux` is from Disk Utility X. Couldn't find a better name.

## Target
- The program should be able to read a config file and move files and folders according to the map
- Should be a binary executable
- The config should support regex
- The organize command should be extensible with only --ft=png,jpg --type=images,dir // eg: images would be from the custom mapping again
